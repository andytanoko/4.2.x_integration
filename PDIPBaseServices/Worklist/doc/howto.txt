Title: WorkList

        This module allows us to manage and process the WorkList.

    1)  In order to add workitem to the worklist we need to call addWorkItem on GWFWorkListSessionObject.java
        this is done in testaddWorkItem method of test case GWFWorkListSessionTestCase.java

    2)  In order to remove workitem from the worklist we need to call dropWorkItem on GWFWorkListSessionObject.java
        this is done in testdropWorkItem method of test case GWFWorkListSessionTestCase.java

    3)  In order to perform workitem from the worklist we need to call performWorkItem on GWFWorkListSessionObject.java
        this is done in testperformWorkItem method of test case GWFWorkListSessionTestCase.java
