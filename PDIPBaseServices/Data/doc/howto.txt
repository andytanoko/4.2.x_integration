Title: DataManager

            This module allows us to manage the context data. Using data manager you can
    create a context and appen,update,remove data with key value pair in this context.

    1)  In order to use this we need to create the context.For example creation of context
        is done in testCreateContext method of test case DataManagerTestCase.java.

    2)  In order to insert or update data into data into context,we need to map data to a ContextKey ,
        this is done in testInsertContextData, testUpdataContextData of test case DataManagerTestCase.java.

    3)  In order to remove the data with some key from the context we need to pass contextkey,this
        is done in testRemoveContextData of test case DataManagerTestCase.java.

    4)  In order to remove complete context we need to pass context uid to removeContext method of
        datamanager,this is done in testRemoveContext of test case DataManagerTestCase.java.
