Procedure for making a major patch (same minor version, different build number)
----------------------------------

1.  Ensure all have delivered their changes and lock integration Stream

2.  Update integration (snapshot) view
    - save update report for future reference
    - create a UCMUtility activity for CI/CO for this major patch.

3.  Update build no. (gridtalk.title.window, gridtalk.build) in resource bundles:
    - GTAS\GridTalk\conf\client\web\i18n\ApplicationResources.properties  
    - GTAS\GridTalk\conf\client\web\i18n\ApplicationResources_ja.properties  

4.  Change c:\my-build.properties
    - uncomment all build settings
 
5.  Build GTAS
   - at command prompt> cd GTAS\GridTalk\projects directory
   - at command prompt> gtas-ant-build

6.  Build backend module archives
    - Open GTAS\GridTalk\projects\backend.jpx in JBuilder
    - Build archives: sender, receiver, senderlite
      sender.jar, receiver.jar, senderlite.jar will be generated to GTAS\GridTalk\deploy folder.
    - Double-check the file size of each .jar file (sometimes the jpx file may be broken which cause jars to be
      incorrectly made. In such case, you need to change the archive properties in jbuilder). 

7.  Run rollout.bat to update the distribution
    - Search and delete *.contrib;*.contrib.*;*.keep;*.keep.* files under the integration view root
    - Run GTAS\GridTalk\rollout\rollout.bat to update the GTAS\GridTalk\rollout folder
    - Delete the following from the rollout folder:
      > application\dist\tomcat-4.0.6
      > appserver\jboss-3.0.5

8.  Update readme.txt
    - Edit GTAS\GridTalk\rollout\application\docs\readme.txt with details of the new patch.

9.  Update patch.bat
    - Edit GTAS\GridTalk\rollout\patch.bat to set "to.build" to the new build no.

10. Update patch.properties
    - Create a GTAS\GridTalk\rollout\patch.properties base on GTAS\GridTalk\rollout\patch.properties.template
    - Update with entries for configurations, data files, dbscripts, and patches to be executed
      This can be done by doing directory and content comparison between the contents of GTAS\GridTalk\rollout 
      folder and the contents of the previous release (use the Heatsoft ADCS software which is very handy).

11. Source control new patch properties
    - Make a copy of patch.properties under GTAS\GridTalk\rollout\patch folder and rename to suffix with the new
      build version.

12. Create patch Zip for release
    - Zip all files in GridTalk\rollout to create the new release zip file.
    - Exclude the following from the zip file:
      > release*.txt, rollout.bat, patch.properties.template
      > upgrade folder
      > patch\patch*.properties that are not in the same minor version
      > patch\exec\* that are not required by all patches in the same minor version
      > application\docs\*.txt except the readme.txt
    - Unzip the release zip file to release distribution folder e.g. D:\Release\dist\GridTalk2.4.1

12. Verify release for clean setup
    - Set GRIDTALK_HOME environment variable to the new release test folder e.g. D:\Release\GridTalk_rel
    - At command prompt> cd to unzipped release folder
    - At command prompt> setup
    - If no errors, start the GridTalk and verify login, registration, etc

13. Verify release for patch-up from previous build
    - Choose an existing GridTalk from the previous build, set GRIDTALK_HOME environment variable to that GridTalk.
    - At command prompt> cd to unzipped release folder
    - At command prompt> patch 
      (it is recommended to REM @echo off, remove -quiet flag for ant, and pipe output for the patch so that you can
       examine if which of the files failed patching.)
    - If no errors, start the GridTalk and verify login, registration, bug-fixes, enhancements, features, etc
    - Verify connectivity, i.e rosettanet gateway, soap b2b messaging, backend webservices, P2P

14. Release the patch
   - If everything is ok, zip up the release distribution folder contents, e.g. GridTalk2.4.1.zip 
   - Put the patch on \\raven\sd-build\GridTalk\2.4, for example.
   - Send email to inform SQA that the patch is ready.

15. Make baseline
    - Check in all modified files (if any)
    - at command prompt cd to integration view root folder
    - at compand prompt> cleartool mkbl -ide -full GT_X.Y_YYMMDD_BX.Y.Z
      where: X is the major version
             Y is the minor version
             Z is the new build number
             YYMMDD is the year, month, day of the release
      For example, GT_2.4_0408012_B2.4.1
    - Complete the CQ activity

16. Unlock integration stream
