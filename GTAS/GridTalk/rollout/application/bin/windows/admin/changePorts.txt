Instructions for changing Ports used by GridTalk
------------------------------------------------

1. Get ready the required Files:
   a. changePorts.bat - for executing the change of ports
   b. sfk.exe         - executable for doing text replacement in affected files
   c. ports.map       - for changing from default ports to a custom set of ports
   d. default.map     - for changing from custom set of ports to default ports

2. Set up ports.map:
   Port numbers on the left-hand-side are the default ports used by GridTalk.
   Customize the ports on the right-hand-side to the desired number. If no change is
   required, put the port number the same to the left-hand-side.

3. Set up default.map: (optional, in case need to change the ports back to default)
   Port numbers on the right-hand-side are the default ports used by GridTalk.
   Customize the ports on the left-hand-side as is done for the ports.map (on the rhs).
   This file should be the exact reverse of ports.map.

   (Make sure GridTalk is not running before performing this step)
4. Go to CMD prompt where the above files are placed in a single directory,
   type> changePorts.bat ports.map
   See below for Notes on changing specific ports.

5. Startup GridTalk and login (using changed port) to verify that everything is OK.

6. If there is need to revert to default ports, repeat steps 4-6, this time
   using default.map and changing the customized ports to default port values.
   Note that same steps apply if there is need to customize the ports again to 
   some other values. There is just need to set up a file that maps the current ports
   to the new ports, and supply this file to changePorts.bat.

--- Notes on changing specific ports -----
A. Changing any port
   If GridTalk has been installed as Windows service, execute service.bat to remove the service before Step 4.
   Re-install the service after Step 4.

B. Changing Login redirection port (default 9099)
   a. If the above port is customized to some other value, say, 28099
   b. Edit WEB-INF/web.xml in gtas.war (zip file) in 
      GRIDTALK_HOME/jboss-<x.x.x>.GA/server/default/deploy/gtas.ear (zip file)
   c. Replace all occurrences of 9099 to 28099.
   d. Put the changed file back to gtas.war, which is put back to gtas.ear.

C. Changing of GridTalk backend listening port (default 6763)
   The backend sender configuration files need to be altered as follows:
   a. If the above port is customized to some other value, say, 28763
   b. Edit the sender.ini, senderlite.bat or send.bat (could be some other names) from the 
      deployed location of backend sender
   c. Replace all occurrences of 6763 to 28763.

D. Changing of Jndi port (default 31099)
   This need to be changed manually as follows:
   a. If the above port is customized to some other value, say, 41099
   b. Edit the gtas-schedule-service.xml in GRIDTALK_HOME\jboss-<x.x.x>.GA\server\default\deploy\gtas.ear
   c. Replace all occurrences of 31099 to 41099.
   c. Put the changed file back to gtas.ear.
   
List of Ports used by GridTalk (default)
---------------------------------------
443   -  SSL connection port
35432 -  GridTalk Database server port
4444  -  JBoss internal service port
4445  -  JBoss internal service port
5001  -  GridTalk Backend Webservice monitor service port
6763  -  GridTalk Backend listening port
8009  -  AJP connection port (for connection to Apache server)
8080  -  HTTP connection port
8083  -  JBoss Webservice port
8093  -  JBoss MQ service port
9099  -  GridTalk Login redirection port
12345 -  GridTalk Logger service port
31098 -  Naming Service RMI port (Jndi)
31099 -  Naming Service port (Jndi)


IMPORTANT NOTE: 
DO NOT EXECUTE changePorts.bat MORE THAN ONCE CONSECUTIVELY ON THE SAME .MAP FILE! THIS
MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS IF ANY OF THE DEFAULT PORTS MATCHES PARTIALLY IN ANY OF THE PORTS TO 
CHANGE TO.  FOR EXAMPLE, 1099=21099 WILL CHANGE ALL OCCURRENCES OF 1099 to 21099 ON FIRST
EXECUTION. ON SECOND EXECUTION, 21099 will be changed to 221099, WHICH IS NOT A VALID PORT.
IF A MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE ON FIRST EXECUTION, THEN EXECUTE THE REVERSE MAPPING (default.map)
FIRST BEFORE RE-EXECUTING THE MODIFIED ports.map.
ALTERNATIVELY, REFRAIN FROM USING PARTIAL MATCH PORT NUMBERS.
