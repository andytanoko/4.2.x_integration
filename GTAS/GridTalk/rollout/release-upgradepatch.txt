Procedure to make an upgrade patch (different minor version)
----------------------------------

1. Use a view for the target version
   - create a UCMUtility activity in CQ for CI/CO for this upgrade patch.
   - Do a complete rebuild (if not done yet), following steps 4-7 in release-majorpatch.txt

2. Unzip the release patch zip file for the source version e.g. GridTalk2.3.4.zip

3. Prepare the upgrade properties
    - Create a GTAS\GridTalk\rollout\upgrade\X_Y_Z-X_A_BS#.properties  (similar to patch.properties)
      where:
              X is the major version
              Y is the source minor version
              Z is the source build number
              A is the target minor version
              B is the target build number
              # is the upgrade script number (usually is 1 unless more is needed to control the sequence of patching)
    - Update with entries for configurations, data files, dbscripts, and patches to be executed
      This can be done by doing directory and content comparison between the contents of GTAS\GridTalk\rollout 
      folder and the contents of the source release (use the Heatsoft ADCS software which is very handy).
    - Source control the new upgrade properties

4. Update upgrade.bat
   - Update curr.ver, curr.build as the source version (X_Y) and build number(Z) respectively
     Update upgrade.ver, upgrade.build as the target version (X_A) and build number (B) respectively
     Update num.scripts as 1 (usually)

5. Prepare readme file
   - Create a readme file for the upgrade under GTAS\GridTalk\rollout\application\docs, 
     e.g. GridTalk2.3.4-2.4.1-upgrade.txt
   - Update with details of what's new after upgrade, and the instructions to do the upgrade.
   - Source control the new readme file.

6. Create the upgrade zip file
    - Zip all files in GridTalk\rollout to create the new upgrade zip file.
    - Exclude the following from the zip file:
      > release*.txt, rollout.bat, patch.properties.template
      > patch\*.properties
      > patch\exec\* that are not required by all patches in the upgrade
      > upgrade\*.properties  (retain the newly created upgrade properties)
      > application\docs\*.txt that are not relevant to the upgrade 
        (retain the readme files for source and intermediate versions)
    - Unzip the release zip file to release distribution folder e.g. D:\Release\dist\GridTalk2.3.4-2.4.1-upgrade

7. Verify the upgrade patch
    - Choose an existing GridTalk from the source version, set GRIDTALK_HOME environment variable to that GridTalk.
    - At command prompt> cd to unzipped release folder
    - At command prompt> upgrade
      (it is recommended to REM @echo off, remove -quiet flag for ant, and pipe output for the patch so that you can
       examine if which of the files failed patching.)
    - If no errors, start the GridTalk and verify login, registration, and features that are new from the upgrade
    - Verify connectivity, i.e rosettanet gateway, soap b2b messaging, backend webservices, P2P

8. Release the upgrade patch
   - If everything is ok, zip up the release distribution folder contents, e.g. GridTalk2.3.4-2.4.1-upgrade.zip 
   - Put the patch on \\raven\sd-build\GridTalk\2.4\upgrade, for example.
   - Send email to inform SQA that the patch is ready.

9. Check in all modified files 
   - Complete the CQ activity
