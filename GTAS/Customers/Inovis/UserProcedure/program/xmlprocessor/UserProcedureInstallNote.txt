# Objective
This user procedure aim to resolve the limitation in the Gridmapper which can not perform looping on the column header. It contain both "pre-process" and "post-process" function. For "pre-process" it will generate the format that can be processed by the GridMapper. For the "post-process", it will take the intermediate xml file generated from the GridMapper and produce the final copy of the RN 4A4 document.

This user procedure also can handle the limitation in the Gridmapper to convert from RN 4A5 XML to 4A5 flat file.
