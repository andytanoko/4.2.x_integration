User Procedures:
****************
"infineon-proc.jar" contains the following user procedures:
1. com.gridnode.infineon.ReceiveConfirmationProc
   Purpose      : Use for sending email notification with attachement when a confirmation document arrives at GTAS.
   Config. File : receive-conf.properties
   Req. Files   : all files under data\alert\userproc\report folder

Changes from Version 1.0
************************
Due to the implementation of GridTalk Alert Center, most of the user procedures are obsolete (can be replaced
in one way or another by the Alert Center features. Thus, in this release, all user procedures are removed, only 
com.gridnode.infineon.ReceiveConfirmationProc is retained.

Also, due to changes in Java procedure invocation changes, method signatures with types more specific than
the Data types available in User procedure configuration are no longer accepted. Thus, the sendEmailNotification()
method signature in com.gridnode.infineon.ReceiveConfirmationProc is also changed to accept an Object type instead
of GridDocument. 

Instructions for upgrade from Version 1.0:
******************************************
1. Copy "infineon-proc.jar" from this distribution and replace the existing "infineon-proc.jar" under the
   "GRIDTALK_HOME/jboss-3.0.5_tomcat-4.0.6/bin/gtas/data/sys/uproc/jar" folder.

2. The code2role.properties and code2mail.properties are now obsolete. It is required to migrate them to the Email Code Reference file format.
    Please refer to the sample Email Code Reference format in the gtas/data/alert/email/emailcode-ref.xml file.
 
3. Existing Message Templates with <%UserDocument.EMAIL_CODE_RECIPIENTS%> need to be replaced with <%RecipientList.DYNAMIC_RECIPIENTS%>.
 
4. User Procedure: ReceiveRNAckProc is replaced by Document Received By Partner alert type which is automatically triggered based on Alert Trigger.
    a) For each docType configured in gtas/data/alert/userproc/receive-rnack.properties:
    i.  Ensure that the Alert to be raised (docType.alert) is of "Document Received By Partner" Alert Type.
    ii. Create an Alert Trigger:
        - Level = 1, 
        - Alert Type = Document Received By Partner, 
        - Document Type = docType,
        - Alert = Select the alert from i
        - Recipients: Add one EMAIL_CODE entry for each docType.emailcode
 
    b) Removing obsolete configurations:
    i. The ReceiveRNAckProc User Procedure configuration
    ii. Partner Function and Trigger for receiving of RN_ACK.
 
5. User Procedure: ReceiveDocumentProc is replaced by Document Received alert type which is triggered by Raise Alert workflow activity based on Alert Trigger.
    a) For each docType configured in gtas/data/alert/userproc/receive-doc.properties:
    i.  Ensure that the Alert to be raised (docType.alert) is of "Document Received" Alert Type.
    ii. Create an Alert Trigger:
        - Level = 1, 
        - Alert Type = Document Received ,
        - Document Type = docType,
        - Alert = Select the alert from i
        - Recipients: Add one EMAIL_CODE entry for each docType.emailcode
    iii. Edit the Partner Function for Receiving of docType documents:
        - Remove the ReceiveDocumentProc user procedure workflow activity
        - instead, replace with Raise Alert workflow activity on "Document Received" Alert Type.
 
    b) Removing obsolete configurations:
    i. The ReceiveDocumentProc User Procedure configuration
 
6. User Procedure: ReceiveRNExceptionProc is replaced by Process Instance Failure alert type which is automatically triggered based on Alert Trigger.
    a) For each docType configured in gtas/data/alert/userproc/receive-rnexcept.properties:
    i.  Ensure that the Alert to be raised (docType.alert) are of "Process Instance Failure" Alert Type.
        NOTE: The Default Process Instance Failure Alert can be used if no customization of the message template is required. Thus this step will not be necessary.
    ii. Create an Alert Trigger:
        - Level = 1, 
        - Alert Type = Process Instance Failure, 
        - Document Type = docType,
        - Alert = Select the alert from i (or Default Process Instance Failure Alert if step i is skipped)
        - Recipients: Add one EMAIL_CODE entry for each docType.emailcode 
    
    b) If Default Process Instance Failure Alert is used, 
    i. Edit the PROCESS_INSTANCE_FAILURE_EMAIL Message Template:
       - Add <%RecipientList.DYNAMIC_RECIPIENTS%> in the "To" field.
     
    c) Removing obsolete configurations:
    i. The ReceiveRNExceptionProc User Procedure configuration
    ii. Partner Function and Trigger for receiving of RN_EXCEPTION.


Instructions for first time configuration:
******************************************
1. Configure a Procedure Definition using the "infineon-proc.jar".

2. Configure a User Procedure for each user procedure mentioned above. 
   i.  Use Java Procedure with Internal JVM
   ii. Provide class name as per above and "sendEmailNotification" as the method name.
   iii. Configure 1 parameter with "Object" data type and "GridDoc" data source.
 
3. For each document that needs email notification with attachement when a confirmation document arrives,
   i. Configure a Response Track Record for the document type
   ii. Add a User Procedure workflow activity in the Partner Function for the document.
   iii. Use the ReceiveConfirmationProc user procedure.
   iv. Add a DocType-Template mapping for the document type in receive-conf.properties.

4. Place all files under data\ folder in corresponding folder under the GTAS data directory.
