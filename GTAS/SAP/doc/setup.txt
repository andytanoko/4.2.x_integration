Setup steps for SAP GT
----------------------

<deployment during development>
-> During development, the my-build.properties should have the following settings:

appserver.name=sapnw
appserver.version=6.4
appserver.home=C:/Release/SAP/deployment
appserver.deploy.dir=${appserver.home}/components
appserver.lib.dir=${gridtalk.home}/JC00/j2ee/cluster/server0/bin/ext
appserver.client.lib.dir=${gridtalk.home}/JC00/j2ee/j2eeclient
#this is commented off as it is not needed when client is deploy on the same j2ee server)
#appserver.client.lib=sapj2eeclient.jar,exception.jar,logging.jar  
appserver.app.data.dir=${gridtalk.home}/SYS/global/GNapps
appserver.app.conf.dir=${gridtalk.home}/SYS/global/GNapps/conf

db.home=${gridtalk.home}/SYS/global/GNapps/mysql

-> The EAR file will be deployed to a fixed directory C:/Release/SAP/deployment/components.
If setup.appserver.conf is defined, the following files will also be copied to the deploy.dir:
./gtas.dlp
./gtas.rar
./components/*.jar

-> Unrar the gtas.rar on the directory itself.

-> extract app-user.jar from gtas.ear and place it under the appserver.deploy.dir.

-> To deploy the EAR to the J2EE server, go to Deploy Tool and open the gtas.dlp project. 
   See below for more details to deploy the EAR and other server components.


<One-time configuration>
1. HTTP Provider
   Visual Administrator -> Cluster -> Dispatcher -> HTTP Provider
   - Ports
     (Port:9099,SocketQueue:200,AcceptingThreadsCount:10,BindAddress:,Type:http)(Port:8080,SocketQueue:200,AcceptingThreadsCount:10,BindAddress:,Type:http)(Port:443,SocketQueue:200,AcceptingThreadsCount:10,BindAddress:,Type:ssl)
   - KeepAliveTimeout   50

   Visual Administrator -> Cluster -> Service -> HTTP Provider
   - FileBufferSize   40960
   - MinFileLenghtFOrLongDataTransfer   512000
   - MinimumGZipLength  81920   (Increase for large file transfer)

  
2. Deploy JDBC driver
   Deploy Tool -> gtas.dlp -> Server Components -> MySQL.jar -> Ctrl+P

3. Login Module
   Deploy Tool -> gtas.dlp -> Server Components -> gridnode_login_module.jar -> Ctrl+P

   Visual Administrator -> Security Provider -> Runtime -> Properties
      -> select LoginModuleClassLoaders property -> change value to "library:GridNode User Login Module"
         (this is the display name given to the login module in library SDA)
         -> click Update -> click Save

   Visual Administrator -> Security Provider -> Runtime -> User Management -> click Manage Security Stores
      -> select active UME User Store
      -> click Add Login Module -> Enter:
         Class Name: com.gridnode.pdip.app.user.login.UserLoginModule
         Display Name: PDIPUserLoginModule (arbitrary name)
         Description: PDIP User Login Module (arbitrary)
         Options:
           Name            Value
           debug           true
           freezeTimeout   10
           maxWrongCred    3
   
   Visual Administrator -> Security Provider -> Runtime -> Policy Configurations -> click Add under Components
      -> enter "gridtalk" for name of policy configuration
      -> under Authentication tab, click "Add New"
      -> select PDIPUserLoginModule (or any arbitrary Display name given for the login module) -> OK
      -> Select "REQUISITE" for the Flag of the added Login Module

5. User mapping
   Visual Administrator -> Security Provider -> Runtime -> User Management -> Create User
      -> Create a user with name mapping to the user id of the corresponding user in GridTalk


6. Deployment setting
   Visual Administrator -> Cluster -> Service -> Deploy -> Properties
   -> Add to Initially_Not_Started_Apps:  gridnode.com/GridTalk 
   -> Click Update -> Save (requires restart appserver)

   (Note: this setting is to prevent the application to be started when the webAS is start up. 
    As there's a problem with stopping the application, this allows the re-deployment to take place before
    without the need to stop the application.)

   -> Strict_J2EE_Checks   true (use for development)
                           false (use for production)

7. tools.jar (for JSP)
   Config Tool -> Instance -> Server -> General tab
   -> Include path to tools.jar JDK library in Classpath  

Restart J2EE server
   
<deploy application>
8. Deploy Tool -> gtas.dlp -> Deployer -> Deploy Ear (or Update if already deployed before)
   Deployer will prompt for start application when deploy / update is completed.
      
9. To start application without re-deployment, Visual Administrator -> Cluster -> Service -> Deploy
   -> Start Mysql database for GridTalk

   Method A:
   -> Select Application option
   -> Select gridnode.com/GridTalk (in stopped state) and click Start Application button.
      click Ok.
      when the application is started successfully, the state icon will be changed to 'tick'.

   Method B:
   -> Telnet localhost on port 50004
      Login id: Administrator  password: admin
      > jump 0
      > add deploy
      > start_app gridnode.com/GridTalk
      > list_app  (repeatedly to check status)
