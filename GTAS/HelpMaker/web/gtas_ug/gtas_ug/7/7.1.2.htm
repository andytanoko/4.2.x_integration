<h3>7.1.2 To create a search query for searching by user document </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Step 1.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click “Search” in the navigation tree (which is accessed by way of the “Documents” tab). The browser will bring you to the Search Query list view page.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 2.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>In the Search Query list view page, click Create Search Query. Then the Create Search Query detail view page will show up for you to create a new search query.</span>
</p>

<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 3.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Enter Name and Description for that search query you are creating.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 4.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Next you will have to set the criteria for the Search Query. There are two types of criteria – Grid Document and User Document. It is required for you to set Grid Document criteria (refer to Step 5 through Step 8 of Chapter 7.1.1 for details).</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>

</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 5.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>If you choose User Document, enter the XPath that points to the value in the user document that you want to search.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p align='center'><span><img src='../images/image065.jpg' width='435' height='155'></span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 6.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Next choose the operator. Some operator requires you to enter 2 or more values for the search condition, e.g. Between and In. To enter multiple values, use either a common “,” or a semi-colon “;” to separate the values.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p align='center'><span><img src='../images/image066.jpg' width='435' height='157'></span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><a name='_Ref78172584'><span>Step 7.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To share the search query with the other user in the application, check the checkbox Public. By default, the search query will only be viewed by the owner who created this query.</span>
</a>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>If the search query is set as Public, the other user is allowed to modify the query but only owner or the user with Admin role is allowed to delete such query.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 8.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To save the Search Query, click on the Save Search Query link. Then the search query’s name will be displayed under Search in the navigation tree. For example, Query1. Click on the link of that name, and upon clicking it, the search query will be executed. Later you will see the Search Query you have just created in the Search Query list view page.</span>
</p>

</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><a name='OLE_LINK14'><span>Step 9.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To remove a condition, tick the checkbox next to the selected condition, and then click on the Remove Condition link. The condition(s) checked will be deleted.</span>
</a>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 10.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Refer to Chapter 7.2 to run the Search Query and view the search results.</span>
