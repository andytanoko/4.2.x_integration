<h3>3.6.5 Files </h3>
<p><b></b>
</p>
<p><span>Some fields allow you to store files. These fields consist of a text box, a browse button and a link entitled “Add/Remove Files”. If the field already has files in it, then their filenames will be displayed with a checkbox next to each file’s name.</span>

</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>To add a file to the field, click the Browse button. A dialog box will appear to allow you to select the file to be added. Having selected the file, you will note that its full path will appear in the text box to the left of the Browse button. Click <u>Add/Remove Files</u>
 and the page will be refreshed. The length of time taken depends on the size of the file that was selected, as its contents must be transmitted to the server from your computer. When the page reappears, you will see the name of the file with a checkbox to the left of it. </span>

</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Not all file fields allow more than one file to be stored. If this file field only allows one file, the textbox and the Browse button will not reappear. For those that do allow multiple files, the textbox and Browse button will still be available, and you may repeat the process to add additional files to the field. For example, when you import files in the Import Document detail view page.</span>

<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>To remove files from the field, click the checkboxes of those files that are to be removed and then click <u>Add/Remove Files</u>
. You may add a new file and remove existing ones at the same time. </span>
