<h2>3.1 Tabs </h2>
<p></p>
<p><span>The tabs (such as “Documents”, “Process”, and “Registry” etc) are used to navigate between different pages of the application. Only one tab will be active at a time and the active tab is highlighted in a different colour.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>The set of tabs shown depends on whether you are in the “admin” or the “user” area of the application. The admin area is generally used by administrators and in fact provides access to the same tabs as they are provided in the user area, with some addition of some extra tabs providing access to parts of the application used for configuration. To move between the user and admin areas, a link is provided. </span>
