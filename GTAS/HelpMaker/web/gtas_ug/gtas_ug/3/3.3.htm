<h2>3.3 Navigation Panel </h2>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>The navigation panel presents a hierarchical list of links to various functions of the application. An example of a function can be a certain list view page or other types of screens like Company Profile page, etc. Clicking (single clicking) the underlined text causes the associated screen to be displayed in the panel on the right. The links that are displayed in the navigation panel depend on which of the available tabs at the top of the screen is selected. The tabs are selected by clicking them (a single click), and it can take a second or two for the new screen to be displayed.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Some links have a small plus (+) sign in a little box next to them. You can click on this plus sign to reveal hidden links. You will notice that when you move the mouse pointer arrow over the symbol, it will itself change to indicate that this is clickable. Unlike the hand symbol used for links, a plus symbol will be shown. Like links, these objects require only a single click to activate. Once expanded, the plus symbol will change to a minus symbol (-) to indicate that another click will hide the revealed links again.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>The following series of screenshots illustrates this. Here we are clicking on the plus sign to the left of the “Communication Profile” link. We have already clicked the link itself and in the main panel in the screenshot below you will observe that the list view shown is for “All Communication Profiles”</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>When you click the plus symbol for the “node” in the tree, its “children” are displayed:</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p align='center'><img src='../images/image011.jpg' width='190' height='138'></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>All these nodes are listed beneath “Communication Profile” and like the “Communication Profile” node, they link to the list view of Communication Profile records – however rather than showing all the records, they narrow down the list to a subset of the records. The “Partner” link will cause the list of all Partner Communication profiles to be displayed in the list view page.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In the navigation panel for some other tabs, you may see that the “child nodes” are themselves expandable. As you might expect, clicking it will reveal more nodes with links:</span>
</p>
<span><br clear='all'></span>
