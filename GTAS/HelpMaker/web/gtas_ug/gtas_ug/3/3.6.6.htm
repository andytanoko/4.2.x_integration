<h3>3.6.6 Embedded List Views </h3>
<p><b></b>
</p>
<p><span>Some Detail View pages contain one or more “embedded” list views. These embedded list views function in a similar manner to normal list views but are usually used for managing child records of a parent record. Unlike a normal list view, the View, Edit, and Create links of an embedded list view make use of the diversion mechanism rather than opening new windows. Embedded list views also lack a paging mechanism or an explicit refresh link.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>In some cases, an embedded list view allows you to change the order of its rows by providing <u>Up</u>
 and <u>Down</u>
 links. Clicking these links will move the selected records in the embedded list view up or down relative to the unselected records.</span>
