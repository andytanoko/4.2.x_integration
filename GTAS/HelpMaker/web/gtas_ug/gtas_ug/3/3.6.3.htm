<h3>3.6.3 Checkboxes and Radio Buttons </h3>
<p><b></b>
</p>
<p><span>A checkbox is a small box that may contain a checkmark. Checkboxes may be in one of two states: checked or unchecked. Usually a checked value will correspond with a “true” or “yes” meaning. To change the value of a checkbox, simply click the box. If it is checked, the check will be removed. If it is not checked, it will become checked.</span>

</p>
<p><span>Radio buttons are similar to checkboxes, but they work as a group. They are usually rendered with a round shape by most browsers. Among a group of radio buttons, only a single radio button may be checked at any one time. When you click the radio button corresponding to the option you want, the previously selected radio button will be unchecked.</span>
