<h1>3 Using GridTalk User Interface </h1>
<p></p>
<p><span>The GridTalk application (“application” is a term used to describe a type of computer program) is accessed using a web browser. With the exception of the web browser software which is usually already installed on users (we use the term “user” to refer to a person who uses the “application”) computers, no additional client software (“client software” is software that is used to access a “server” application”. A server is a dedicated central computer that runs one or more “applications” that are accessed by many people at the same time) needs to be installed to access GridTalk. Upgrades to the GridTalk server will also not require any changes to be made to each client machine.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Your system administrator should have already ensured that your computer has a browser installed that is suitable for accessing GridTalk.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Browsers that may be used to access GridTalk are Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6 and above and Mozilla version 1 and above, including Netscape version 7. (The Mozilla browser is free and may be downloaded from </span>
<b><span>www.mozilla.org</span>
</b>
<span> versions are available for most common operating systems including Microsoft Windows and Linux. The Netscape Browser may be downloaded from </span>
<b><span>www.netscape.com</span>
</b>
<span> and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 may be obtained from </span>
<b><span>www.microsoft.com</span>
</b>
<span> - note however that you should check with your companies technical support before installing new software on your computer). Limited support is provided for Netscape version 6 but its use is not recommended. Microsoft’s “Internet Explorer” browser is usually installed as a standard application on computers that run Microsoft’s “Windows” operating system. As mentioned however, your computer should already be loaded with a suitable browser so it is most unlikely that you will ever need to install any additional software yourself to use GridTalk. If in doubt, please contact your company’s technical support.</span>
