<h1>2 Registration </h1>
<p></p>
<p><span>In order to login to GridTalk, you will need to have a GridTalk user record created for you. Like other configuration records, these records are created from the web interface and so require you to be logged in already. To allow you to log in the first time there are two predefined accounts created.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Take note that you can login with the same user account on multiple machines.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>If you are an administrator, just key in “admin” for User ID, followed by “admin” for Password. To confirm the entries, click Login. Take note that you can press the Enter key instead of clicking Login.</span>
</p>

<span>Enter the user name. The default user name is “admin”</span>

<p><span>Step 3.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>If necessary, select the Timezone. This Timezone defaults to the timezone of the machine on which the browser is running. In most cases, this will be the same timezone as the user is in. However, in the case of remote users, this may differ. It is unfortunately not possible to automatically determine the user timezone as the browser only provides information on its offset from UTC, which does not include other necessary information such as daylight savings rules. The offset is used to narrow down the list of timezones. The available timezones are based on what is provided by the Java Virtual Machine in which the server runs and this often provides more than one timezone for the same place but with different names. The interface has been coded such that UTC time is always selectable. The selected timezone is used to format all date time information displayed so that it is in the local time. For example, if a document arrived at 9am Singapore time, a user in Singapore would see 9am displayed while the same document displayed to a user in Greenwich would display as 1am.</span>

</p>
<p><span>Step 4.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click on the Login button. The browser will show the Unregistered page with the Registration and Profile tabs. At the Registration tab, it shows the blank fields to be entered and, as you have not registered yourself yet, the information “Registration State Product not registered” is read here. Before being able to complete your registration, you must have the node-locked license file that will be provided by GridNode or its representatives. .</span>
