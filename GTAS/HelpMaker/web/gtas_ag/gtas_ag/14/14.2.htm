A Valid archived document is termed as such if, during archival, all expected related records and files exist and are archived as a whole as one document. An Invalid archived document is termed as such if, during archival, any expected related records or files could not be found and not archived with the document. In short, archived documents marked Invalid are those that have missing records or files during the archival.</span>

</p>
<p><span>For <b>From Create Date</b>
, <b>To Sent Date</b>
, <b>To Received Dat</b>
e, and <b>To Doc. Date</b>
, the date portion can be specified without the time portion, which is then assumed to be 00:00. The time portion is automatically attached with the seconds and milliseconds portion 00.000. The matching archived documents would have its create/sent/received/doc date later than or equal to the specified date and time.</span>
</p>
