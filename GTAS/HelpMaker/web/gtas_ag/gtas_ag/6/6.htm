<h1>6 Alert Notification Centre </h1>

<p><span>Alerts are used to notify a user of what is going on in GridTalk. An alert is triggered when a certain event occurs at the GridTalk server. </span>
</p>

</p>
<p><span>Every alert is of a certain predefined type, which can be broadly categorized as follows:</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>

<ul type='disc'><li><span>License alerts – these are used to signal license expiring/expired.</span>
