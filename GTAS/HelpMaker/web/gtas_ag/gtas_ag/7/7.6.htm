<h2>7.6 Certificate Expiry and Notification </h2>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>The GridTalk application will check routinely on the validity of the certificates in the database. If a certificate has expired or is due to expire in certain number of days’ time, an alert notification will be sent out to you by email. By default, this certificate expiry checking routine is scheduled on installation time and carried out daily at the same time. This schedule may be changed following the steps in Chapter 0. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>The certificate expiry checking routine is implemented using a Java user procedure as shown below:</span>
