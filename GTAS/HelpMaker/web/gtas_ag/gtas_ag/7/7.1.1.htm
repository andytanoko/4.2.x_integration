<p><b><span>Packaging Profile:</span>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>This field provides the packaging details for that channel. The details are based on the envelope of that packaging profile.

They are RNIF1 and RNIF2. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>RNIF1 specifies that responses must always follow signals. This means that a workflow might receive a response after the receipt acknowledgement. RNIF2 allows out-of-sequence receipt of signals. For example, a workflow might receive a response before the receipt acknowledgment.</span>
</p>
