<p><span>After GridTalk has run for a long time, there will be a lot of data in the system of which some data is no longer used frequently. This “unused” data will affect the system efficiency so it needs to be extracted from the database and archived. This stored data can be restored to the database later if needed. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Performing an archive will remove the items archived from the database. When restored from the archive, the items will be inserted back to the database as what it was before.</span>

<p><span>Over a period of time, temporary files that are deposited in your system for an unspecified period may cause sluggish system performance. As such, GridTalk provides a utility to enable you to configure the schedule for housekeeping those files such as log files and temporary files. This feature is a simple way of keeping your drive free from useless file clutter.</span>
