<h2>9.1 Configuring Partner Functions </h2>
<p><b><span></span>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>Now that you know a partner is someone you need to build a specific function to trigger the business process, each partner may have specific functions, which are called partner functions.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Partner functions are used to define the workflows in the exchange of business documents.</span>
</p>

</p>
<p><span>A Partner Function is composed of one or more workflows which are made up of workflow activities. For instance, on receive of a document you can generate an automated response to send back to your partner, and at the same time, you can export it for your backend ERP system.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>The table illustrates the list of workflow activities and their meanings:</span>

</p>
</td>
<td width='477' valign='top'><p><span>This exit signals the end of the chain of workflow activities in the current folder. The immediate workflow activity that follows, if any, may act upon the document in the originating folder. </span>

</p>
<p><span>For the multiple workflow example mentioned above, the partner function can be defined with the following sequence of workflow activity types:</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<ol start='1' type='1'><li><span>Exit to Outbound</span>
</li>
<li><span>Mapping Rule – Transform to response</span>
</li>
<li><span>Exit to Channel</span>
</li>
<li><span>Exit Workflow</span>
</li>
<li><span>Exit to Export</span>
</li>
<li><span>Mapping Rule – Convert to Flat File</span>
</li>
<li><span>Exit to Port – ERP Backend</span>
</li>
<li><span>Exit Workflow</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>As you may notice, activities 1 to 4 constitute one workflow, and activities 5 to 8 constitute another workflow. Each workflow in the Partner Function is demarcated by an Exit Workflow activity type. </span>
