<h3>9.4.2 To cancel a process instance </h3>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>When a Process Instance is in progress, the user can choose to cancel the process. This option allows the user to stop the process in progress without generating additional retries or exception messages.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>If the process instance has failed, the failure reason is shown as well. This can be either a RosettaNet Exception received, or perhaps cancelled by the user.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>When a process is cancelled, a 0A1 Failure Notification process will be initiated to the trading partner of the original process that has been cancelled. However, for the failure PIP to be initiated successfully, the appropriate Process Mapping must be configured for 0A1 Failure Notification between you and your trading partner. Refer to Chapter 9.5 for details on configuring Process Mappings.</span>
</p>

<p><span>Step 1.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Process Instances. This will bring you to the Process Instances panel on the left. When a process is performed, it will appear under the Process Instances folder. </span>
