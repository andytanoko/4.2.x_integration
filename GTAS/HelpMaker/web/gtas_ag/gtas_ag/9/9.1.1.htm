</span>
<span>Next go to the Workflow Activities section. To create a workflow activity, click Create Workflow Activity. The screen appears. Enter the following fields for the General section.</span>

</p>
<p><b><span>Description:</span>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>This field gives the descriptive purpose of that partner function. This field is not enabled for entry.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><b><span>Activity Type:</span>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>This field allows you to configure one or more workflow activities in the partner function.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 8.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Next proceed to the Suspend section to enter the following fields:</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><b><span>Dispatch Interval (sec):</span>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>This field allows you to specify the interval after which you can resume the suspended workflow activities.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><b><span>Dispatch Count:</span>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>This field allows you to specify the number of workflow activities to resume at a time.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>The ‘Suspend’ options allow workflow processing to be suspended for a configurable amount of time before continuation. This feature is useful under situations of heavy load e.g. large amount of concurrent incoming documents and there's need to regulate the concurrent execution of workflow processes by limiting the number of concurrent execution of the same workflow activity at any instant. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>An example of usage is to suspend the Export of incoming RosettaNet documents till a later dispatch time, giving resources for processing the return of the RosettaNet Receipt Acknowledgements to the sender. In this case, in the &quot;;Exit to Export&quot;; (or Exit to Port) activity, a Dispatch Interval can be configured to force the processing to proceed several seconds later. This relinquishes resources to another workflow process, which is started for sending RosettaNet Receipt Acknowledgements. The Dispatch Count controls the maximum number of suspended &quot;;Exit to Export&quot;; activities that will be dispatched at each dispatch time. </span>

</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 11.<span> </span>
</span>

</p>
