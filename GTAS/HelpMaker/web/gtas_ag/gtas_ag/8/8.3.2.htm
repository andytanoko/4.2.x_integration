<h3>8.3.2 To create a content mapping rule </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>The Content Mapping Rule is used for manipulating the user document. When creating a content mapping rule, you need to specify the type that is used to split, transform or convert a user document.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Step 1.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Mapping Rules under the Mapping folder.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 2.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Expand the Mapping Rules folder, and click Content. The Content Mapping Rules list view page is displayed.</span>
</p>

</p>
<p><a name='_Ref78114984'><span>Step 3.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Create Mapping Rule. The Mapping Rule detail view page appears. Take note that the Header Transformation checkbox is empty by default.</span>

</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 4.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Enter Name and Description.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 5.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Next select Type. There are three available types such as Convert, Split, and Transform.</span>
</p>
<p><span>To use Split and Transform, your user document must be a XML file.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 6.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Specify Source Doc Type by selecting the Document Type from the drop-down list. If the document type you want is not found, click on the <img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image011.gif'>icon to create a new document type. This indicates the document type for the input user document.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 7.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Specify Target Doc Type by selecting the Document Type from the drop-down list. If the document type you want is not found, click on the <img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image011.gif'>icon to create a new document type. This indicates the document type for the output user document after the mapping rule is applied.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 8.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Specify Source Doc File Type by selecting the File Type from the drop-down list. If the file type you want is not found, click on the <img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image011.gif'>icon to create a new file type. This indicates the file type of the input user document.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 9.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Specify Target Doc File Type by selecting the File Type from the drop-down list. If the file type you want is not found, click on the <img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image011.gif'>icon to create a new file type. This indicates the file type of the output user document after the mapping rule is applied.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 10.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Select the Mapping File from the list box. If the mapping file you want is not listed, click on the <img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image011.gif'>icon to create a new file type. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>

</span>
<span>If you have selected Split for Type, you need to define, additionally, the following fields:</span>

</p>
<p><span>This indicates a set of unique values in the user document that will be used for the splitting.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><b><span>Param Name</span>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>This indicates the name of a parameter defined in the XSL that is used in the Mapping Rule for splitting. This parameter will contain each unique value extracted from the user document using the specified XPath. </span>
</p>

</p>
<p><b><span>Keep Original</span>
