<h3>8.3.1 To create a header mapping rule </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>A Header Mapping Rule is a XSL used for transforming the Grid Document. You are provided with five default header Mapping rules, which allow you to select to execute the mapping between the folders. <span></span>
You can create your own header Mapping rule to extract information from the user document/reference file into the Grid Document.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 1.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Mapping Rules under the Mapping folder. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 2.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Expand the Mapping Rules folder and click Header. The Header Mapping Rules list view page is displayed.</span>

</span>
<span>Click Create Mapping Rule. The screen appears. Take note that the Header Transformation checkbox is ticked by default. Since it shows that the type of mapping rule is Header, the Type field is disabled.</span>

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p><span>Step 5.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Select the Mapping File from the list box. If the mapping file you want is not listed, click on the <img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image011.gif'>icon to create a new mapping file. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 6.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Tick Transform With Source if you want to extract information from the user document (The user document has to be a XML file). The full path to the user document will be passed into the XSL mapping file through the parameter UDOC. You have to define this parameter UDOC in the XSL.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 7.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Tick Transform With Ref Doc if you want to extract information from a reference file (Mapping File of type Reference Doc). Once this checkbox is ticked, you are prompted to enter Ref Doc by selecting from the list of defined reference document mapping file. If the reference document Mapping File is not listed, just click Create Mapping File to create it. The full path to the reference document will be passed into the XSL mapping file through the parameter REFDOC. You have to define this parameter REFDOC in the XSL. </span>

</p>
<p><span></span>

Click on the selected mapping rule’s hyperlink under Name in the table. If you wish to update the selected mapping file, click Edit Mapping Rule.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 10.<span> </span>
</span>

<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 11.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To delete the Header mapping rule, tick the Select checkbox of the mapping rule you want to delete. As you see a mark appear in that checkbox, click Delete Mapping Files.
