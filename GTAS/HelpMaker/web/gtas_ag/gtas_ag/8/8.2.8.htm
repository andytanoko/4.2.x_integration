<h3>8.2.8 To create a new XPath mapping file </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>An XPath mapping file is a file used for extract information from an XML user document in two occasions:</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>1.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>The XML document is imported from the backend server into GridTalk but the partner information is not readily known during import, but this information exists in the document itself.</span>
</p>
<p><span>2.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>The XML document enters a folder in the GridTalk system during partner function execution, and some document information is necessary to be present in the GridDocument header for subsequent processing.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>An XPath mapping file can be crafted using an XML editor or any text editor, and then inserted into GridTalk as follows:</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 1.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Mapping. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 2.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click XPath under Mapping Files. The XPath Mapping Files list view page is displayed.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><a name='_Ref154980841'><span>Step 3.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Create Mapping File. The Mapping File detail view page is displayed.</span>
</a>
<span> </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 4.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>In the Mapping File detail view page, enter the mandatory fields.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 5.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Select XPath for the Type field.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 6.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Select the file by clicking Browse. The File selector is displayed where you can select a XPath file.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><a name='_Ref154980854'><span>Step 7.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Save Mapping File. The new mapping file will be displayed in the Mapping Files or XPath Mapping Files list.</span>
</a>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 8.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To add more XPath mapping files, repeat Step 3 through Step 7. If you want to view the mapping file, go to the XPath Mapping Files page where you will see the records listed in the table. Click on the selected mapping file’s hyperlink under Name in the table. If you wish to update the selected mapping file, click Edit Mapping File. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 9.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To edit the XPath mapping file, select the mapping file and then click on the corresponding Edit button<img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image013.gif'>. The </span>
<span>Mapping File page is displayed.</span>
<span> Update the entries of the mapping file as necessary. Click Save Mapping File.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 10.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To delete the XPath mapping file, tick the Select checkbox of the mapping file you want to delete. As you see a mark appear in that checkbox, click Delete Mapping Files. The message box, “Are you sure you wish to delete these Mapping Files?” will appear. To confirm the deletion, click OK. The selected mapping file will be removed from the Mapping Files page and the XPath Mapping Files page.</span>
