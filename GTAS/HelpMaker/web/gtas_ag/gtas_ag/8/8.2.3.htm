<h3>8.2.3 To create a new reference doc mapping file </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>A reference doc is a XML file that can be used by other mapping files such as XSL where they can refer to the reference document to extract information from it. When supplied, the XSL mapping rule may use values in the Reference Doc using XPath. An example is a lookup table that provides supplier codes to be filled into an XML document that is being sent out.</span>
