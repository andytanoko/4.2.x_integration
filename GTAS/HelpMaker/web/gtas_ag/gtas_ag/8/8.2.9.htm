<h3>8.2.9 To create a new Java binary mapping file </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Java Binary is used to convert data files from one format to another. It is basically a set of Java classes that are created via the MapForce</span>
<sup><span>TM</span>
</sup>
<span>, hence it can handle a lot of different type of conversion MapForce is supporting. For now, the Java Binary can only take in one input file and output one single file. Once the Java Binary file is ready, the Java binary can be inserted into GridTalk.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Step 1.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Mapping. Then click Java Binary under Mapping Files. The Java Binary Files list view page is displayed.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 2.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Create Mapping File. The Mapping File detail view page is displayed. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 3.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>In the Mapping File detail view page, enter the mandatory fields.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 4.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Select Java Binary for the Type field.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 5.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Select the file by clicking Browse. The File selector is displayed to select the Java Binary file.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 6.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Save Mapping File. The new mapping file will be displayed in the Mapping Files and Java Binary Mapping Files pages.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 7.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To add more Java Binary mapping files, repeat Step 2 through Step 6. If you want to view the mapping file, go to the Java Binary Mapping Files page where you will see the records listed in the table. Click on the selected mapping file’s hyperlink under Name in the table. If you wish to update the selected mapping file, click Edit Mapping File. </span>
</p>

</p>
<p><span></span>
