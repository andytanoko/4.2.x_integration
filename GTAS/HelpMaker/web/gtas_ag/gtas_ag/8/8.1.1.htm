<h3>8.1.1 To create a new document type </h3>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>All documents that you manage using GridTalk should be classified into types. Examples of document types include purchase orders, RFQs (requests for quotation) and customer invoices. An examination of your business processes should help you identify the most appropriate classifications for your documents.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>It is recommended that the GridTalk administrator be in charge of classifying, creating and maintaining the record of document types in GridTalk.</span>

UC refers to unclassified documents that could be used for documents that you could use for testing purpose. RN ACK is one of the RosettaNet based document types used to indicate RosettaNet Acknowledgment of Receipt.</span>
