<h3>8.2.5 To create a new schema mapping file </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>An XML Schema is used to describe and constrain the content of XML documents. The XML Schema may be imported using the XML Schema configuration view.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>An XML schema represents the interrelationship between the attributes and elements of an XML for a document or a portion of a document.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>To create a schema for a document, you analyze its structure, defining each structural element as you encounter it. For example, within a schema for a document describing a book, you would define a ‘Book’ element, a ‘Title’ element, and other elements that describe possible content divisions within the document.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Step 1.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Mapping. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 2.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Schema under Mapping Files. The Schema Mapping Files list view page is displayed.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><a name='_Ref78114774'><span>Step 3.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Create Mapping File. The Mapping File detail view page is displayed.</span>
</a>
<span> </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 4.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>In the Mapping File detail view page, enter the mandatory fields.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 5.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Select the file by clicking Browse. The File selector is displayed where you can select a Schema file.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 6.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Select Schema for the Type field.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 7.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Enter the Sub Directory field if required. This field stores the schema file under subdirectories instead of directly under root. For example, “invoice/” would save the schema file under the data/sys/validation/schema/invoice directory. The directory “data/sys/validation/schema” is the default root directory for schema files. The “invoice” sub-directory is the sub path.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><a name='_Ref78114781'><span>Step 8.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>Click Save Mapping File. The new mapping file will be displayed in the Mapping Files or Schema Mapping Files list.</span>
</a>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 9.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To add more Schema mapping files, repeat Step 3 through Step 8. If you want to view the mapping file, go to the Schema Files page where you will see the records listed in the table. Click on the selected mapping file’s hyperlink under Name in the table. If you wish to update the selected mapping file, click Edit Mapping File.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 10.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To edit the Schema mapping file, select the mapping file and then click on the corresponding Edit button<img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image013.gif'></span>
<span>. </span>
<span>The Mapping File page is displayed.</span>
<span> Update the entries of the mapping file as necessary. Click Save Mapping File.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 11.<span> </span>
</span>
<span>To delete the Schema mapping file, tick the Select checkbox of the mapping file you want to delete. A mark appears in the checkbox. Click Delete Mapping Files. You will be prompted to confirm the message box, “Are you sure you wish to delete these Mapping Files?’ Then click OK. Then the selected mapping file will be removed from the Mapping Files page and the Schema Mapping Files page.</span>
