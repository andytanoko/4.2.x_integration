<h2>16.1 Configuring HTTPS Connections </h2>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>HTTPS connections to send messages can be configured in the Communication feature where you can create a communication profile for an active RosettaNet or HTTPS-enabled partner. </span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>As shown in this figure, the Communication Profile feature allows the HTTP endpoint to be defined in the form of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) as specified in RFC 1738. For example, an endpoint for a partner for might be configured as <a name='OLE_LINK11'><b>http://www.partner.com:1234/httpReceiver/receiver</b>
</a>
. Once a connection is configured, messages to this Partner GridNode will be sent via HTTP to this URL.</span>

<p><span>HTTPS provides support for transport level encryption of HTTP messages over SSL. To send messages to a partner using HTTPS, use &quot;;https&quot;; as the protocol, e.g. <b>https://secure.partner.com:443/httpReceiver/receiver</b>
. </span>
