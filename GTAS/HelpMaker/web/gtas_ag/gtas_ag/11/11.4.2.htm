</p>
<p><b><i><span>User Name</span>

</p>
<p><span>Select the partner you want to assign the web services so that the partner is allowed to access or invoke the web service. Click <img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image011.gif'>to create the partner if the partner you authorize is not listed in the drop-down listbox.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span>Password</span>
</i>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>Enter the authentication password for the partner. The password should contain at least six characters.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>

</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span>WebServices</span>
</i>
</b>
</p>
<p><span>Select the list of available services that you allow the partner to access. These services are already created earlier. Click <img width='16' height='16' border='0' src='../images/image011.gif'>to create the web service if the web service to assign is not listed in the list box.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>Step 5.<span> </span>
